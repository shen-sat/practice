### Assumptions ###

 - A plateau is divided into a grid
 - A starting position of '0 0 N' means a rover starts in the bottom left corner of a plateau and is facing North
 - The square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1)
 - Inputs for plateau and each rover's starting position have a space between each character
 - Inputs for each rover's instructions do not have spaces between each character
 - User will press enter after an empty input to finish input session and get results  

### Design ###

I have used objects to represent the controller, input parser, plateau and rover. The controller object takes in user input and passes this to the input parser. The input parser object raises an error for incorrect input and standardizes correct input to pass to plateau and rover. Rover object takes inputs for starting position and instructions and then moves the rover and returns its end position. Plateau object holds on to plateau input.

The app runs and returns the correct output for the supplied test input.
